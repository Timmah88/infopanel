find the PID (Process ID) of your python script using the command (should be the second column)
Code: Select all

ps -ef | grep python
Then kill it soothly first
Code: Select all

kill <PID found previously>
And if does not work, then go for the ultimate stop
Code: Select all

kill -9 <PID found previously>
If the program is still running then it means you are using the wrong PID
Nothing can stop a kill -9 command :-)
